## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Sass SCSS
- Font Awesome

### What I learned

- I learn about anchor link outline.

- I learn how to improve my javascript code.

- I learn about responsive grid with minmax.

- I learn about custom grid order with grid-area.

- I learn about how to use Font Awesome.

- I learn about custom Main and Page html structure.

### Continued development

I wondering how to hide / disable activated dashboard on device mode by clicking outside window.

Also I don't have any idea how to complete the project without Javascript code, since the description says that it's possible to complete the project by only using html and css.

### Useful resources

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Even though the project gives a great svg for icon, there is no wrong using Font Awesome.

- [Outline and Focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvu5OMGcdVA) - Kevin Powell about Outline, Hover and Focus.

- [Anchor Without href](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2886413/anchor-without-href/2886421) - I used it for toggle and outline dashboard.
