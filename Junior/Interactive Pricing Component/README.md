## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vanilla js and css
- Custom range / slide input

### What I learned

I learned so much from this project.

- Range Input

I just knew that there is something called Range Input @.@. Basically it's an input element / tag with range as its type.

I knew this after I messing up by creating a mimic of this Range Input haha. Well, at least it doesn't go in vain, i learn more actually.

- Custom Range Input

I could modify some of Range Input component after searching for tutorial on internet. But I still can't manage to show image on slider thumb in Chrome. But I managed to do good in Firefox. I'm not sure what cause it.

- CSS Custom Properties with Javascript

I learn about how to add custom properties or css variable from javascript. I do this to add some effect into Slider Bar.

- I learn that I could add image in css content properties

I always use `::before` or `::after` to put image, I just knew that I also can add Image in the base class too.

- Linear gradient has another parameter

I just knew that `lineargradient` also has range of continuity of color.

- Different approach for each browser version and type

Now I know why Front end development is hard. Each browser has its own approach and mechanic. Some css doesn't work on other browser. So it's developer job to optimize all of features become reality in every browser, though it's seems impossible.

### Continued development

I'd like to know how to format string into 0.00 format. I could do it in C# using toString('0.00') but i do not know how to achieve that in javascript.
